Midnimo College Website

This is a website I made for Midnimo College. It is a college that teaches technology courses like frontend, backend, full stack and data analysis.

I created this website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript only. It is a frontend project and there is no backend. The purpose of this project is to practice frontend development and design a modern college website.
